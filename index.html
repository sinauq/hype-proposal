<h2 id="orgf570d2b">Current State</h2>
<p>
First, let's look at the current state of Hype websites
</p>

<p>
(Both Iran and International)
</p>

<h4 id="org638608b">Poor performance</h4>
<p>
To measure website's performance we use <a href="https://web.dev/measure/">Google's analysis tool</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is the result for <b>hype.ir</b> on mobile with Irancell's data network:
</p>


<div id="org4665b26" class="figure">
<p><img src="files/mobile-irancell.png" alt="mobile-irancell.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Not very impressive!
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org51181cb">
<h4 id="org51181cb">Why these measures are important?</h4>
<p>
Google uses these measurements to rank websites on its search
results. A lower rank means you won't have much visibility on Google.
</p>

<p>
So if your plan is to improve your online presence, which we highly
recommend, having a performant website is the essential first step.

<h4 id="org57d9d5f">Responsive styling of Hype.ir has occasional problems</h4>
<p>
In past 10 years web browsing on mobile devices saw a surge and
surpassed browsing on desktops (i.e. laptops) in recent years.
</p>

<p>
Today having a mobile friendly website is a must.

<p>
For brands which rely on Instagram to communicate with their audience,
having a good mobile website is even more important.
</p>

<p>
Having a responsive website, you can direct followers to your website
for information and be sure that they won't end up at a web page that
doesn't work correctly on their devices.

<section id="slide-org9f4ee67">
<h3 id="org9f4ee67">A review of Hype.com International</h3>
<p>
We reviewed the international website to get a sense of what hype is
doing and to become more familiar with your brand.
</p>

<p>
The summary is that aside from a beautiful design, good use of some
simple web techniques made the website a valuable component in
conveying brand personality.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org82494c7">
<h4 id="org82494c7">Motions and transitions</h4>
<p>
All over the website small transitions are implemented with an
impressive precision to give the pages the sense of action that Hype
is known for.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org56d6fdb">
<h4 id="org56d6fdb">Small videos</h4>
<p>
To boost the energy, there are also small autoplaying videos embeded in pages.
</p>

<p>
It's very important that these videos load fast. The use of latest web
technologies (aka HTML5) helped designers achieve this.
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgfaa686b">
<h4 id="orgfaa686b">A few examples</h4>
<p>
To elaborate on these points we have collected a few screencasts from the site.
</p>

<p>

<div style="font-size: 0.6em;font-weight:bold">(hit play if the videos didn't start automatically)</div>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgfaa686b-split">
<p>
Transition are added to each product image. The choice of speed and
"Ease Out" slope for the motion gives the page a nice little kick.

<p>
Small video in the middle of home page
</p>
<video src="files/poc-video section.mp4" type="mp4" loop autoplay="true" controls />

</section>
<section id="slide-orgfaa686b-split">
<p>
We loved how , in Header menu, the 45 degree slant of the Hype cans amplifies the motion.

<section id="slide-orgd504ca9">
<h4 id="orgd504ca9">But Hype.com has a poor performance too</h4>
<p>
&#x2026;even worse than hype.ir!
</p>

<p>
The result is that for a short tail search keyword like <b>"Hype"</b>
hype.com is on second page of Google results, way behind brands with
similar names.
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org3cd71c5">
<h2 id="org3cd71c5">So how would an ideal website for Hype.ir look like?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Should loads fast (even on slow connections),</li>
<li>with a meticulous implementation of transitions and small web
animations that is in par with broader brand image of Hype,</li>
<li>a better presence on Google search results,</li>
<li>and perfect user experience on mobile devices (especially on builtin
Instagram browser).</li>

<h3 id="orgbf7f68d">A static website</h3>
<p>
Static websites are loading super fast and therefore friendly to
situations were Internet connection is not stable, like what we're
experiencing in Iran.
</p>

<p>
<i>please slide down to read two examples from our own experience with
static websites</i>
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgbf7f68d-split">
<ul>
<li>Taskulu's landing pages were on Wordpress. By migrating to a static
site strategy we saw a 25% boost in load time, and 15% growth
in Google's performance grade.</li>

<li>In Kamva the improvements were even higher, but it was mainly
because the old website was not well maintained.</li>

</ul>

<section>
<section id="slide-org12a8d9e">
<h3 id="org12a8d9e">An admin panel (CMS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>We offer also an admin panel that allows you to focus on the content
and leave worrying about style to us,</li>
<li>The panel will have builtin support for standard requirements such
as SEO, assets management and more. But also has lots of plugins
that can extend the functionality based on your need.</li>

</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org114573c">
<h3 id="org114573c">But why not a Wordpress website?</h3>
<p>
Wordpress has become the de facto tool for building blogs, business
websites, and even ecommerce. But in our experience maintaining a
Wordpress website gets unwieldy as the size and requirements of the
business grows.
</p>

<p>
The solution we are offering allows you to scale and not worry how it
affects the websites performance and load time.
