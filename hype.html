<h2 id="org168a148">Current State</h2>
<p>
First, let's look at the current state of Hype websites
</p>

<p>
(Both Iran and International)
</p>

<h4 id="orgb3eb3f2">Poor performance</h4>
<p>
To measure performance of a website we use <a href="https://web.dev/measure/">Google's analysis tool</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is the result of loading <b>hype.ir</b> mobile with Irancell data
network:
</p>


<div id="org2639f33" class="figure">
<p><img src="files/mobile-irancell.png" alt="mobile-irancell.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Not very impressive!
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org9cd4685">
<h4 id="org9cd4685">But why performance is important?</h4>
<p>
Google uses these measurements to rank websites in its search
results. A lower rank means you won't have much visibility on
Google.
</p>

<p>
So if your plan is to improve your online presence, having a
performant website is the essential first step.

<h4 id="org2727fb0">Responsive styling has occasional problems</h4>
<p>
In past 10 years web browsing using mobile devices saw a surge and
even surpassed broswing from desktop (ie. laptops) in recent years.

<p>
For brands which rely on Instagram to communicate with their audience,
having a good mobile website is even more important.
</p>

<p>
This way you can direct followers to your website for information and
be sure that they don't end up on a web page that doesn't work
correctly on her device.

<h3 id="org5ec4cd8">A review of Hype.com International</h3>
<p>
We reviewed the international website to get a sense of what hype is
doing and to become more familiar with your brand.
</p>

<p>
The summary is that aside from a perfect design, good use of some
simple web techniques made the website a valuable component to convey
brand personality.
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org294a444">
<h4 id="org294a444">Motions and transitions</h4>
<p>
All over the website small transitions are implemented with an
impressive precision to give the pages the sense of action that Hype
is known for.
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org547449a">
<h4 id="org547449a">Small videos</h4>
<p>
To boost the energy, there are small videos in some pages.
</p>

<p>
It's very important that these videos load fast. The use of latest web
technologies (aka HTML5) helped designers achieve this.
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgbe349d3">
<h4 id="orgbe349d3">But Hype.com has a poor performance too</h4>
<p>
&#x2026;even worse that hype.ir!
</p>

<p>
The result is that for a short tail keyword like <b>"Hype"</b> hype.com is on
second page of Google results.
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org6074cb8">
<h2 id="org6074cb8">So how would an ideal website for Hype.ir look like?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Should load fast (even on bad connections),</li>
<li>with a meticulous implementation of transitions and small web
animations that is in par with broader brand image of Hype,</li>
<li>a better presence on Google search results,</li>
<li>and perfect user experience on mobile devices (especially on builtin
Instagram browser).</li>

<h3 id="orga6b5d25">A static website</h3>
<p>
Static websites are loading super fast and therefore friendly to
situations were Internet connection is not stable, like what we're
expriencing in Iran.
</p>

<p>
Here are two exmpales from our own experience:
</p>

<p>
<i>please slide down</i>
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-orga6b5d25-split">
<ul>
<li>Taskulu's landing pages were on Wordpress, by migrating to a static
site strategy we saw a 25% boost in load time, and 15% growth
in Google's performance grade.</li>

<li>In Kamva the boost was even higher, but it was mainly because the
old website was not well maintained.</li>

</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org9fec18b">
<h3 id="org9fec18b">An admin panel (CMS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>We offer also an admin panel that allows you to focus on the content
and leaves worrying about style to us,</li>
<li>The panel will have builtin support for standard requirements such
as SEO, assets management and more. But also has lots of plugins
that can extend the functionality based on your need.</li>

</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org5316f96">
<h3 id="org5316f96">But why not a Wordpress website?</h3>
<p>
Wordpress has become the de-facto tool for building blogs, business
websites, and even ecommerce. But in our experience maintaining a
Wordpress website gets unwieldy as the size and requirements of the
website grows.
</p>

<p>
The solution we are offering allows you to scale with worrying how it
affects the websites performance and load time.

design up to the deployment of the website on your servers.
