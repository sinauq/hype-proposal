            <h4 id="org394f526">Why these measures are important?</h4>
            <p>
              Google uses these measurements to rank websites on its search
              results. A lower rank means you won't have much visibility on
              Google.
            </p>

            <p>
              So if your plan is to improve your online presence, which we
              highly recommend, having a performant website is the essential
              first step.

            <p>
              In past 10 years web browsing on mobile devices saw a surge and
              surpassed browsing on desktops (i.e. laptops) in recent years.

              For brands which rely on Instagram to communicate with their
              audience, having a good mobile website is even more important.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having a responsive website, you can direct followers to your
              website for information and be sure that they won't end up at a
              web page that doesn't work correctly on their devices.

            <p>
              We reviewed the international website to get a sense of what hype
              is doing and to become more familiar with your brand.
            </p>

            <p>
              The summary is that aside from a beautiful design, good use of
              some simple web techniques made the website a valuable component
              in conveying brand personality.

              All over the website small transitions are implemented with an
              impressive precision to give the pages the sense of action that
              Hype is known for.

              To boost the energy, there are also small autoplaying videos
              embeded in pages.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's very important that these videos load fast. The use of latest
              web technologies (aka HTML5) helped designers achieve this.
